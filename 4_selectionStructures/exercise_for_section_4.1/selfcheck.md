# Self-Check

1. Assuming x is 15.0, and y is 25.0, what are the values of the following conditions?

    `x != y` is true  
    `x < x` is false  
    `x >= y - x` is true  
    `x == y + x - y` is true
2. Evaluate each of the following expressions if

    `a = 6`  
    `b = 9`  
    `c = 14`  
    `flag = 1`

    a. `c == a + b || !flag` is false  
    b. `a != 7 && flag || c >= 6`is true  
    c. `!(b <= 12) && a % 2 == 0`is false  
    d. `!( a > 5 || c < a + b )` is true
