## 2

Write a function that computes the time one must leave in oreder to reach a certain destination by a designated time. You need to deal only with arrivals occuring later in thes same day as departure. Function inputs include the arrival time as integer on a 24-hour clock (8:30 pm = 2030), the distance to the destination in kilometers, and the speed you plan to average in km/h. The function result should be the required departure time (rounded to the nearest minute) as an integer on a 24-hour clock. Also, write a driver program to test your function.
