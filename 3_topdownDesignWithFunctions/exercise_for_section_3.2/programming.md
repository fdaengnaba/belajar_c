# Programming

## 1

Write statements that compute and display the absolute difference of two type `double` variables, x and y(|x-y|)

`fabs(x - y)`

## 2

Write a complete C program that promts the user for the coordinates of two 3-D points (x_1, y_1, z_1) and (x_2, y_2, z_2) and display the distance between them computed using the following formula:

`distance = ((x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 + (z_1 - z_2)^2)^0.5`
